-   Code details:
    -   The heart of the game is BoardManager script, which is handling the entire game from beginning to end while utilizing the classes and functions defined in other scripts
    -   The logic for Chess AI that is implementation of AI algorithm is written in ChessAI script
    -   The comments and meaningful variable/function names will be helpful to understand the code
-   You can refer report for screenshots and related details.
